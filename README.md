## Configurations

Different verifications use different structure configurations.
For all delta measure verification, the configurations are all compatible with the ACWF.
While for bands measure and convergence workflow, the configurations used are set in file `statics/cif/mapping.json`.
The principles are for bands measure, using the configurations from Cottiner's paper since they are the groud state structures exist in real wolrd.
And for lanthanides using the Nitrides from Wenzowech paper.
Using the uniaries/diamond configurations for convergence verification.

## For maintainers

To create a new release, clone the repository, install development dependencies with `pip install '.[dev]'`, and then execute `bumpver update`.
This will:

  1. Create a tagged release with bumped version and push it to the repository.
  2. Trigger a GitHub actions workflow that creates a GitHub release.

Additional notes:

  - Use the `--dry` option to preview the release change.
  - The release tag (e.g. a/b/rc) is determined from the last release.
    Use the `--tag` option to switch the release tag.
