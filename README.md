## Logic of convergence test on different criteria protocol

The wavefunction cutoff scan list are same no matter which criteria protocol is used.
Therefore, the running of wavefunction cutoff test write wavefunction cutoff recommendation for all criteria protocol.
When switching to other criteria protocol, the wavefunction cutoff test can be skipped by setting `preset_ecutwfc`. It will then be used and only run charge density cutoff test.
This is not conflict with the caching workflow, since caching workflow will only run on wfc test the results is that for caching workflow when `preset_ecutwfc` is set, only reference calculation is run.

## Lanthanides

For lanthanides the delta measure is run on nitrides as Wentzcovitch paper and on oxides.
The unaries are not run for delta since it is know that the oxidation state of lanthanides pseudopotentials is not zero.
Only for lanthanide nitrides the magnatization is on.
It is mostly because the reference of RE-N (Wentzcovitch) and RE-O (ACWF) is run with/without magnatization.
The kpoint distance of lanthanide nitrides is hard code to `0.2` using the tetrahedron method rather than as acwf protocol where kpoint distance is `0.10` with fermi-dirac smearing, in order to compatible with Wentzcovitch paper results.
Lanthanide nitrides such as ErN, in equation of state calculation, large (0.06) volume change lead to supurious energy.
To mitigate the issue, the `scale_increment` is set to 0.01 (??? probably only for Er?) to make sure the volume change is in the parabolic range.
The nitrogen pseudopotential is the one from first run on pseudopotentials verifications on nitrigen on libraries include Pslibrary 0.1, Pslibrary 1.0.0, pseudo-dojo, ONCVPSP with legacy sg15 inputs... (Run and check)
The lanthanides have convergence issue if mixing is too large or number of bands is not enough.
For bands measure, the `nbnd_factor` is set to `2.0` while for delta measure and convergence the factor is set to `1.5`.
The mixing is set to 0.5 (default is 0.7 for non-lanthanides), and even smaller for atomic calculation of lanthanides elements which set to 0.3.

## Criteria and protocol of pressure convergence

Since the magnitude of pressure (P = 1/3 Tr(sigma)) directly output from DFT calcultion depends on the stiffness of the material strongly.
We convert it into an equivalent volume.
This what we call it residual volume is therefore a stiffness-agnostic value that can be used to set criteria for all elements.

## Phonon frequencies specification

For some elements, we have neglected the first n frequencies in the summation above, because the frequencies are negative and/or with strong oscillations as function of the cutoff for all the considered pseudos). We have neglected the first 4 frequencies for H and I, 12 for N and Cl, 6 for O and ??SiF4 (which replaces F)??.
## bands distance compare specification

### bands distance of magnetic structures

The bands of magnetic structure has one more dimension to distinguish up and down spins.
In bands distance comparing, I simply reduce the array along the last axis e.g. does not distinguish the spins but
merge eigenvalues (sorted) of the same kpoints.

### bands distance protocol specifications

There are three kinds of kpoint distance (`kpoints_distance_scf`, `kpoints_distance_bands` and `kpoints_distance_band_strcuture` respectively) for bands measure workflow and two for bands distance convergence workflow where the band structure is not calculated in convergence verification.

In the production protocol, `kpoints_distance_scf` and `kpoints_distance_bands` are set to `0.15`.
We choose a uniform k-grid for bands distance comparison,
in the full Brillouin zone and with symmetry reduction which not implemented in previous version.
After applying symmetry reduction, it is able to compute with more dense grids.
Because, choosing a high-symmetry path could result in an unsatisfactory arbitrary choice,
as different recipes for the standardisation of paths have been introduced in the recent literature and interesting features of the band structure may occur far from the high-symmetry lines (such as Weyl points).
A uniform mesh is also more appropriate from the point of view of electronâ€™s nearsightedness
if the energy eigenvalues are known on a sufficiently fine uniform k-points mesh,
it is possible to get an exact real-space representation of the Hamiltonian in a Wannier function basis and then interpolate to an arbitrary fine mesh.

## Parameters of protocol

### Specific parameters for magnetic elements

For atomic energy calculated for cohesive energy, it is hard to converge for magnetic elements with untreated parameters.
The following extra parameters are added for the calculation:

```
"SYSTEM": {
    "nspin": 2,
    "starting_magnetization": {
        self.ctx.element: 0.5,
    },
},
"ELECTRONS": {
    "diagonalization": 'cg',
    "mixing_beta": 0.5,
    "electron_maxstep": 200,
},
```

## Resource options and parallelization

## parallelization for atomic calculation

In case of atomic calculation running on a machine with too many CPUs,
the `npool` and `ndiag` is explicitly set to 1 for atomic calculation.
Since there is only one kpoint in atomic case, there is no efficient lost of this parallelization setting.

### Walltime settings

The max wallclock seconds are set from the `options` input parameters from verification workflow.
This option will then pass to all the inside pw and ph calculation process as the `metadata.options` setting.
The `options` dict has the format of:

```python
{
    "resources": {
        "num_machines": 1,
        "num_mpiprocs_per_machine": 32,
    },
    "max_wallclock_seconds": 1800,  # 30 min
    "withmpi": True,
}

```
where the `max_wallclock_seconds` is exactly used for pw calculation while for ph calculation the value is set to 4 time of value since the ph calculation roughly estimated to elapse 4 times slower that pw calculation of the corresponding pw calculation to finish.


## Configurations

Different verifications use different structure configurations.
For all delta measure verification, the configurations are all compatible with the ACWF.
While for bands measure and convergence workflow, the configurations used are set in file `statics/cif/mapping.json`.
The principles are for bands measure, using the configurations from Cottiner's paper since they are the groud state structures exist in real wolrd.
And for lanthanoids using the Nitrides from Wenzowitch paper for bands measure and convergence otherwise hard to converge in scf calculation.

But the structures used for convergence verfication are varias.
The lanthanides still using the nitrides from Wenzovitch paper.
We keep on using typical nature configuration from Cottiner's paper, but convert them to primitive with pymatgen (for magnetic elements, no primitive convert process but still refine with `pymatgen`).
Maybe the flourine (F) still have thekproblem mentioned in legacy SSSP that hard to convergence (SCF convergence), will rollback to use SiF4 for it.


## For maintainers

To create a new release, clone the repository, install development dependencies with `pip install '.[dev]'`, and then execute `bumpver update`.
This will:

  1. Create a tagged release with bumped version and push it to the repository.
  2. Trigger a GitHub actions workflow that creates a GitHub release.

Additional notes:

  - Use the `--dry` option to preview the release change.
  - The release tag (e.g. a/b/rc) is determined from the last release.
    Use the `--tag` option to switch the release tag.

### Logger level

The aiida-core logger level is recommened to set to `REPORT` as default.
In workflow, process related messages are pop to daemon logger in REPORT level.
If process finished with none-zero exit_code, log a waring message.
While for debug purpose, the INFO level is for showing the parameters infomations when processes are launched.
